[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/5114447913d6374d5000e638/badges/065a0ae50d3b8277ebb2/gpa.png)](https://codeclimate.com/repos/5114447913d6374d5000e638/feed)

- Seeds client from client uid
- Seeds default website for each location
- Gardens provide components that make up websites and web pages
- Page builder allows for customization of web pages
- Websites compile and deploy to Heroku
- Read's configurator's feed and updates sibling applications


## Setup

1. Install all the required gems.

    ```bash
    $ bundle
    ```

1. Customize client ENV variable __or don't__. Format is shown.

    ```bash
    $ export G5_CLIENT_UID=http://g5-hub.herokuapp.com/clients/:client-urn
    ```

    Default is `spec/support/client.html` and is set in
    `config/initializers/env.rb`.

    __ProTip™:__ The client uid will be used to seed the database so it must
    to point to an html file that uses microformats to mark up a client and
    their locations.

1. Set up your database.

    ```bash
    $ cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
    $ rake db:setup
    ```

1. Customize garden ENV variables __or don't__. Defaults are shown.

    ```bash
    $ export LAYOUT_GARDEN_URL=http://g5-layout-garden.herokuapp.com
    $ export THEME_GARDEN_URL=http://g5-theme-garden.herokuapp.com
    $ export WIDGET_GARDEN_URL=http://g5-widget-garden.herokuapp.com
    ```

    Defaults are set in `config/initializers/env.rb`.

1. Run the specs.

    ```bash
    $ rake db:test:prepare
    $ rspec
    ```

1. Start the application.

    ```bash
    $ rails s
    ```


### Client Location Deployment

1. [Create a new private key and add it to
   GitHub.](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys)

1. [Also add your private key to
   Heroku.](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys)

1. [Get your AWS S3 credentials ready — for the client's assets](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3)

1. Set ENV variables. See `.env`.

  * if you have issues connecting to S3 (SocketError: getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known) make sure [your region is correct](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html)

1. Install [redis](http://redis.io/) and start it.

1. Start the job queue.

    ```bash
    $ rake jobs:work
    ```


## CSS Naming Conventions

Most CSS will go inside the modules folder. A module is simply a reusable chunk
of CSS. To create a new module do the following:

1. Create a new file inside the modules folder. It should start with an
   underscore and contain the module name. Example: `_panel.css.scss`
1. The module name is the base class, which contains the basic styles for the
   module. Example: `.panel`
1. If there are multiple words in the base class, use dashes. Example:
   `.my-panel`
1. Any component, or part, of the module is a sub-module. The class should be
   the module name, a dash, and the sub-module. Example: `.panel-title`,
   `.panel-footer`
1. For any alternate styles of the module the class should be module name, two
   dashes, and the alternate style name. Example: `.panel--b`, `.panel--large`


## Client Location Sites

- `app/views/layouts/web_template.html.erb` is the layout file
- `app/views/web_templates/show.html.erb` is used to render each page
- `app/assets/stylesheets/web_template.scss` is for __preview mode only__
- `app/assets/javascripts/web_template.js.coffee` is for __preview mode only__
- `app/views/web_templates/stylesheets.scss` is for preview & deployed mode
- `public/javascripts/` if for preview & deployed mode

If you find bugs, have feature requests or questions, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/g5search/g5-content-management-system/issues).


## Specs

Run once.

```bash
$ rspec
```


## Deployment Specs

1. Set deployment ENV variables in `.env.test`. Deploy to your personal Heroku
   account, not G5's.

    ```bash
    HEROKU_USERNAME=your-username
    HEROKU_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ID_RSA=your-private-key
    ```

    __ProTip™:__ See [this dotenv issue](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/issues/21) if you're having issues formatting your ID_RSA.

1. By default deployment specs are not run, you have to specifically run them
   with `rspec -t type:deployment`

   __ProTip™:__ If you're getting a 422 on the Heroku deploy, try [verifying your Heroku account](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification).


## Model & Controller Diagrams

The [railroady](https://github.com/preston/railroady) gem generates Rails model
and controller UML diagrams as cross-platform .svg files, as well as in the DOT
language.

```bash
$ brew install graphviz
$ rake diagram:all
$ open doc/*.svg
```
